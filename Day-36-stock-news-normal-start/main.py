## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#1 list comprehensions on Python dictionaries.[new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
#2 Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price
# 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
# 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
# 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").

## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.
#6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio. 



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
